#### Machine Learning definitions:

Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
Example: playing checkers
E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers.
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.


#### Types of Machine Learning problems:

There are two main categories of Machine Learning problems.
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
